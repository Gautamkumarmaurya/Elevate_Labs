Menu-driven basic calculator built in Java using console input/output.

Uses the Scanner class to take user input.

Provides a menu for four arithmetic operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Each operation is implemented as a separate static method for better organization and reusability.

Runs in an infinite loop, displaying the menu repeatedly until the user chooses to exit.

Prompts the user to enter two numbers for each operation.

Implements division validation to prevent division by zero errors.

Uses a switch statement for efficient menu handling.

Demonstrates:

Java methods

Loops (infinite loop for menu)

Conditional statements (switch-case)

Exception handling (division by zero prevention)

Console-based interaction with the user.
